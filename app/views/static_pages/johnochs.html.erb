			    <p>Hi!  I'm John.  Thanks for exploring BeatTree!</p>
				<p>BeatTree was born out of my own musical curiosity and my desire to build cool, interesting things for the web.  My music tastes are broad, non-specific, and span many different countries, genres, and time periods.  One thing that has always been clear to me when I listen to music is how almost all music is inspired by other music.</p>
				<p>These relationships are most clearly delineated in the hip-hop and rap genres where one piece of music will often explicitly sample another piece of music.  I will often find myself listening to a song and know instantly that the drums, the melody, or some other aspect is derived from another source.  In turn, the samples for a particular song may also sample other earlier works.</p>
				<p>It occurred to me that these relationships between pieces of music can be represented graphically, making deciphering the lineage of a song much easier and more interesting.  By using BeatTree, users create a directed graph of music heredity and can then traverse that graph.  For music-heads like me, this is an amazing capability, a lot of fun.</p>
				<p>Modern music is often built on the shoulders of the giants of a foregone era.  Many of today's hop-hop and rap songs touch on and sample work created by the jazz masters of the Blue Note era, classic Funk and Disco groups, and other rap and hip-hop artists as well.  My hope is that BeatTree will help people gain a better understanding of this heritage and aid the project by contributing their insights.
				<p>I hope you enjoy exploring BeatTree.  If you have comments, suggestions, or are looking for a talented programmer, I urge you to <a href="mailto:john.ochs@gmail.com">get in touch</a> with me.</p>
